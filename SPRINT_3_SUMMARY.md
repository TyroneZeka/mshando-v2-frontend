## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Architecture
```typescript
// Payment State Structure
interface PaymentState {
  payments: Payment[];
  currentPayment: Payment | null;
  customerPayments: PaginatedResponse<Payment> | null;
  taskerPayments: PaginatedResponse<Payment> | null;
  taskPayments: Payment[];
  searchResults: PaginatedResponse<Payment> | null;
  customerTotalPayments: number | null;
  taskerTotalEarnings: number | null;
  // Loading states for different operations
  isLoading: boolean;
  isCreating: boolean;
  isProcessing: boolean;
  isRefunding: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

// Notification State Structure
interface NotificationState {
  notifications: PaginatedResponse<Notification> | null;
  recentNotifications: Notification[];
  unreadCount: number;
  // Loading states
  isLoading: boolean;
  isSending: boolean;
  isMarkingRead: boolean;
  isDeleting: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```
