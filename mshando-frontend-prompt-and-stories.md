# 🚀 Prompt for AI Agent – Build React Frontend for Mshando  

You are an expert frontend developer AI. Your task is to **build a production-ready React frontend** for the **Mshando platform**, based on the provided **Spring Boot microservices API** and the **user stories & acceptance criteria** in this document.  

Follow these rules carefully:  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Setup  
- React (latest) + TypeScript  
- React Router v6 for routing  
- Redux Toolkit (or React Query) for global state & API caching  
- Axios (or Fetch API) for HTTP requests  
- TailwindCSS for styling (clean, responsive, mobile-first)  
- JWT-based authentication with auto-refresh  
- Toast notifications for success/error messages  
- Environment config for API base URLs (`.env` files for dev/staging/prod)  

---

## 📂 Architecture Guidelines  
1. **Authentication Layer**  
   - Implement login, registration, token storage (httpOnly cookie/localStorage), auto-refresh, and role-based routing.  

2. **Routing**  
   - Public routes: landing, login, register.  
   - Role-based dashboards:  
     - `CUSTOMER`: Task management, payments, bids.  
     - `TASKER`: Task browsing, bids, assignments, earnings.  
     - `ADMIN`: User, category, and report management.  

3. **State Management**  
   - Centralized API client with Axios interceptors for JWT.  
   - Use Redux Toolkit slices (or React Query hooks) per domain: `auth`, `tasks`, `bids`, `payments`, `notifications`.  

4. **Error Handling**  
   - Use API error format (`message`, `error`, `details`).  
   - Show user-friendly messages with Toast.  

5. **UI/UX**  
   - Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation.  
   - Responsive tables, forms, and modals.  
   - Role-specific navigation.  
   - Charts for Admin reports (use Recharts).  

---

## 📋 Development Process  
- Implement features **incrementally following the user stories & sprints**:  
  1. Sprint 1 → Authentication & Core Tasks  
  2. Sprint 2 → Bidding & Collaboration  
  3. Sprint 3 → Payments & Notifications  
  4. Sprint 4 → Admin Features & Enhancements  

- For each story:  
  - Build UI components.  
  - Connect API endpoints.  
  - Validate against acceptance criteria.  
  - Ensure proper routing and role-based access.  

---

## ✅ Deliverables  
- Complete React project source code  
- `README.md` with setup instructions (`npm install`, `npm run dev`)  
- Example `.env` file with API base URLs  
- Unit tests for critical flows (auth, task creation, bidding, payments)  
- Clean, modular, documented code

👉 **Instruction to AI Agent**:  
Follow the user stories & sprint prioritization below. Build the project **feature by feature**, starting from Sprint 1. After each sprint, deliver working, tested code before moving to the next sprint.
