### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Redux Store Structure
```typescript
store/
├── index.ts              # Store configuration
└── slices/
    ├── authSlice.ts      # Authentication state management
    ├── taskSlice.ts      # Task management (placeholder)
    ├── bidSlice.ts       # Bidding system (placeholder)
    ├── paymentSlice.ts   # Payment processing (placeholder)
    └── notificationSlice.ts # Notifications (placeholder)
```

#### API Service Layer
```typescript
services/
├── api.ts              # Axios configuration & interceptors
└── authService.ts      # Authentication API calls
```
